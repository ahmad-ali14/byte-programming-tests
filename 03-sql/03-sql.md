# SQL Schema

Prepare a database table to hold Facebook public profile data, an example public profile is

```json
{
  "first_name": "Peter",
  "last_name": "Chang",
  "profile_pic": "https://example.com/13055603_10105219398495383_8237637584159975445_n.jpg",
  "locale": "en_US",
  "timezone": -7,
  "gender": "male",
  "last_ad_referral": {
    "source": "ADS",
    "type": "OPEN_THREAD",
    "ad_id": "6045246247433"
  }
}
```

your table(s) should store all of this information along with the userâ€™s PSID (a string based identifier), and both created at and updated at timestamps. If possible the database should manage both of these timestamps with no additional app code required.

## Constraints

We use PostgreSQL for data storage, but you may use an alternative SQL syntax if there is another DBMS you are more familiar with.
